Week 8 Friday test - Ruby refresher
===================================================

Objectives
===================================================

This week's challenge was to revisit the fundamentals of Ruby. We were given an rspec file with 39 tests and had to make them all pass by writing simple and short methods. Two final challenges had no tests to turn green, but built on things we'd previously learned.

Rules
========================================================

Try and get the RSpec tests to pass (but not by cheating - i.e. hardcoding the expected value)
You shouldn't need any extra libraries or gems
The cleaner your code the better!
Googling is fine as usual

Tips
===================================================

Use the ruby docs http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/String.html.
Try and break down the problems into smaller chunks. For e.g. if you google "How to select elements in an array that start with a", you won't have much luck. Try and find out a) how to select certain elements in an array, b) how to test if a string starts with an 'a'.
Don't forget Enumerable (advanced array methods).
